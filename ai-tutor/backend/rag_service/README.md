# RAG Service Documentation

The RAG service is responsible for handling the GraphRAG model, which retrieves and generates answers based on course resources stored in a Neo4j graph database. The RAG Service is only accessible via the API service. It is built using FastAPI, as its integrated features and minimal setup reduce the need for third-party libraries and configurations, making it ideal for the RAG service.

## Endpoints

- **POST** `/ask`:  
  Accepts a question and returns a response generated by the GraphRAG model.
